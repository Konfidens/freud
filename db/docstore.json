This goes back\nto the 1960s, when it was expressed even by some leading researchers\nwho  had  devoted  their  lives  to  “gold-standard”  RCT  studies,  repre-\nsented by Carl Rogers, Allen Bergin, and Arnold Lazarus (see Bergin &\nStrupp, 1972, and a review by Malan, 1973). Interestingly, this situation\nwas exactly repeated in the 1990s. The following is a single illustration\nchosen  from  many:  Safran  and  Muran  (1994)  reiterated  Bergin  &\nStrupp’s criticisms of RCTs and wrote: “There is an important need for\nmore intensive analysis of single cases in order to yield clinically useful\ninformation.”\nNow, in the 2000s, this view is gradually coming into its own. It is\nrepresented by  the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),\nwhich has “re-written nearly all its funding announcements to reflect\nthe  change  in  priority  from  large  scale  clinical  trials  in  controlled  set-\ntings, to research designed to study large numbers of diverse patients in\nreal-world settings . . .” (Foxhall, 2000).\nMore recent spokesmen for this trend are Ingram and Mulick (2005),\nwho write in a letter to the Editor of the \nAPA Monitor on\n \nPsychology\n that,","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jodde\\OneDrive\\Skrivebord\\Konfidens_sommerjobb\\Repos\\freud\\documents\\David Malan,  Patricia Coughlin Della Selva - Lives Transformed_  A Revolutionary Method of Dynamic Psychotherapy-Karnac Books (2006).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Lives Transformed","Author":"Malan, David H.,Della Selva, Patricia Coughlin","Subject":"prelims: press 16 December 2005","Keywords":"","Creator":"Adobe PageMaker 7.0","Producer":"Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)","CreationDate":"D:20051216100732Z","ModDate":"D:20120607113530-04'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"pdf:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)","pdf:keywords":"","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe PageMaker 7.0","xmp:modifydate":"2012-06-07T11:35:30-04:00","xmp:createdate":"2005-12-16T10:07:32Z","xmp:metadatadate":"2012-06-07T11:35:30-04:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:4cda6627-6c71-42c0-be8c-6048e3dbd682","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:6e80397a-0384-4b27-835f-27f7121131bb","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:description":"prelims: press 16 December 2005","dc:title":"Lives transformed","dc:creator":"Malan & Coughlin Della Selva"}},"totalPages":353},"loc":{"pageNumber":19,"lines":{"from":1,"to":31}}}}],["19",{"pageContent":"real-world settings . . .” (Foxhall, 2000).\nMore recent spokesmen for this trend are Ingram and Mulick (2005),\nwho write in a letter to the Editor of the \nAPA Monitor on\n \nPsychology\n that,\nin  addition  to  RCTs,  at  least  two  other  methodologies  “deserve  to  be\nincluded as part of the pillar of empirical validation”.

Some rupture and misattunement\nbetween a child and his caretakers is unavoidable. When the rupture is\nrelatively minor and repair efforts are made, there is no trauma. When\nthe rupture is significant in intensity or duration, or is not repaired, this\nexperience tends to generate reactive anger, and even sadism, towards\nthe cherished family members who provoked it. In addition, the ensu-\ning \nguilt\n  generated  by  aggressive  impulses  towards  a  loved  one  may\nitself  prove  difficult,  if  not  intolerable,  for  the  child  to  bear,  and  this\nmay also be repressed.\nSelf-directed aggression\nSince humans are dependent for so long, their survival depends upon\nsecure attachments to adult care-takers.

It is important to remember that transference phenomena are\nnot  unique  to  the  therapeutic  setting,  but  are  ubiquitous  in  human\ninteractions.  However,  in  ISTDP,  we  make  every  attempt  to  expose\nthese feelings as soon as they arise, as they are the key to unlocking the\nunconscious system (Davanloo, 1988).

The\nwhole  issue  of  unconscious  processes  has  been  a  hot  topic  of  debate\nwithin our field. Recently, advances in neuroscience have allowed us to\ntest  out  these  hypotheses.

Clearly, this kind of change is clinically significant as well.\nOf  the  22  unemployed  patients,  18  had  returned  to  work  within  9\nweeks  of  treatment.  Significantly,  17  of  these  18  had  been  on  private\ndisability  insurance,  creating  even  greater  cost  savings.  By  the  end  of\ntreatment this group had not only improved dramatically compared to\ntheir pre-treatment status, but their unemployment rate was lower than\nthe city average (Vancouver).\nIn  addition  to  the  personal  benefits  afforded  to  these  patients  by\ntreatment, the cost savings were substantial. “Data gathered from pre-\nscription  administration,  disability  insurance  costs,  and  hospital  and\nphysician  service  costs,  suggest  an  overall  cost  reduction  for  these  89\npatients  to  the  system  of  approximately  $402,523  over  the  12  month\nperiod after therapy” (Abbass, 2002a, p. 230). The savings amounted to\nthree times the cost of the psychotherapy.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jodde\\OneDrive\\Skrivebord\\Konfidens_sommerjobb\\Repos\\freud\\documents\\David Malan,  Patricia Coughlin Della Selva - Lives Transformed_  A Revolutionary Method of Dynamic Psychotherapy-Karnac Books (2006).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Lives Transformed","Author":"Malan, David H.,Della Selva, Patricia Coughlin","Subject":"prelims: press 16 December 2005","Keywords":"","Creator":"Adobe PageMaker 7.0","Producer":"Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)","CreationDate":"D:20051216100732Z","ModDate":"D:20120607113530-04'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"pdf:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)","pdf:keywords":"","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe PageMaker 7.0","xmp:modifydate":"2012-06-07T11:35:30-04:00","xmp:createdate":"2005-12-16T10:07:32Z","xmp:metadatadate":"2012-06-07T11:35:30-04:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:4cda6627-6c71-42c0-be8c-6048e3dbd682","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:6e80397a-0384-4b27-835f-27f7121131bb","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:description":"prelims: press 16 December 2005","dc:title":"Lives transformed","dc:creator":"Malan & Coughlin Della Selva"}},"totalPages":353},"loc":{"pageNumber":50,"lines":{"from":1,"to":32}}}}],["83",{"pageContent":"patients  to  the  system  of  approximately  $402,523  over  the  12  month\nperiod after therapy” (Abbass, 2002a, p. 230).

Some avoid the experience of\nthis  anxiety-arousing  emotion  by  internalizing  it  and  becoming  de-\npressed. Others discharge the emotion via action and act out in destruc-\ntive  ways.

In the literature on\nanger and heart disease, these distinctions are not made, and the emo-\ntion  of  anger  is  equated  with  the  defensive  discharge  of  the  emotion\nthrough angry outbursts.

Facial  expression,  eye  gaze,  tone  of  voice,\nbodily  motion,  and  the  timing  of  response  are  each  fundamental  to\nemotional  messages”  (Siegel,  1999,  p.  121).  In  order  to  “speak”  the\nlanguage of emotion, we must attend to the body and nonverbal com-\nmunication.  In  ISTDP  all  these  signs  of  feeling  are  identified  and  fed\nback to the patient via the interaction with the therapist.\nThese techniques are especially well suited to the goal of facilitating\naffective  involvement  in  the  treatment  process.  Often  the  body  gives\nclues to emotion that are not available on the verbal level. Siegel (1999)\ncontends that “emotions are primarily non-conscious mental processes\nwhich create a state of readiness for action” (p. 132). This “readiness for\naction” is often observed in a patient’s movements. For example, when\nexpressing  anger,  a  patient  might  make  a  fist  or  shake  his  foot,  even\nthough he is not aware of it.

By  helping  our  patients  accurately  identify  and  adaptively  ex-\npress their emotions, we are helping them acquire the skills necessary\nto create intimacy and closeness in their most important relationships.\nThere  is  a  great  deal  of  evidence  that  intimate  relationships  are  a\nbalm, reducing stress and enhancing satisfaction in life (Gottman, 1994;\nGottman & Silver, 1999). Conversely, those who are not able to create\nsustaining relationships suffer from a whole host of physical and psy-\nchological symptoms, and even die earlier, than those with solid sup-\nport from others (Goleman, 1995). It follows, then, that we will do our\npatients an enormous service if we help them experience and express\ntheir feelings in a non-defensive manner.

In order to stop this repetition and acting out of conflicts,\nthe  therapist  must  help  the  patient  to  experience  all  his  true  feelings\ndirectly. This can be accomplished by examining the transference pat-\ntern of behaviour, as well the feelings in current relationships.

Davanloo has always advocated an approach that is\ngeared to the patient’s highest level of capacity. Rather than backing off\nin the face of anxiety and seeking to create “safety”, the therapist first\ntests  out  the  patient’s  ability  to  tolerate  the  anxiety  necessary  to  face\ndifficult  feelings  and  truths  and  then  proceeds  accordingly.  Anxiety\ndoes not get reduced before feelings are experienced, only afterwards.\nIn fact, anxiety often rises as “forbidden” thoughts and feelings become\naroused. If the therapist intervenes to reduce anxiety, she will simulta-\nneously  de-pressurize  the  feelings  generating  that  anxiety  and  delay\nachieving therapeutic goals.\nIn ISTDP, patient and therapist form an alliance based on an agree-\nment to face the truth, no matter how difficult or distressing that might\nbe.

As Peter Levine, co-author of \nWaking the Tiger: Healing Traumas\n(Levine  &  Frederick,  1997),  reminds  us,  humans  (like  all  primates),\nwhen faced with imminent and inescapable harm, instinctively enter a\nstate of consciousness that is akin to freezing. This frozen and detached\nstate  is  a  last-ditch  survival  effort  and  creates  an  altered  state  of  con-\nsciousness in which no pain is experienced. However, what is adaptive\nin  promoting  survival  at  the  moment  of  threat  becomes  maladaptive\nonce the threat has been removed. In fact, to zone out and dissociate can\nrender the trauma victim vulnerable to repeated episodes of victimiza-\ntion, as well as hindering the healing process.\nIt  has  been  suggested  (Levine  &  Frederick,  1997)  that  there  is  a\npsychic  healing  mechanism  available  to  all  of  us  that  is  as  real  and","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jodde\\OneDrive\\Skrivebord\\Konfidens_sommerjobb\\Repos\\freud\\documents\\David Malan,  Patricia Coughlin Della Selva - Lives Transformed_  A Revolutionary Method of Dynamic Psychotherapy-Karnac Books (2006).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Lives Transformed","Author":"Malan, David H.,Della Selva, Patricia Coughlin","Subject":"prelims: press 16 December 2005","Keywords":"","Creator":"Adobe PageMaker 7.0","Producer":"Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)","CreationDate":"D:20051216100732Z","ModDate":"D:20120607113530-04'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"pdf:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)","pdf:keywords":"","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe PageMaker 7.0","xmp:modifydate":"2012-06-07T11:35:30-04:00","xmp:createdate":"2005-12-16T10:07:32Z","xmp:metadatadate":"2012-06-07T11:35:30-04:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:4cda6627-6c71-42c0-be8c-6048e3dbd682","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:6e80397a-0384-4b27-835f-27f7121131bb","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:description":"prelims: press 16 December 2005","dc:title":"Lives transformed","dc:creator":"Malan & Coughlin Della Selva"}},"totalPages":353},"loc":{"pageNumber":223,"lines":{"from":1,"to":30}}}}],["430",{"pageContent":"It  has  been  suggested  (Levine  &  Frederick,  1997)  that  there  is  a\npsychic  healing  mechanism  available  to  all  of  us  that  is  as  real  and\npowerful as the healing capacity of our physical bodies.

As  already  men-\ntioned, five of the seven patients had an openly malignant parent.\n(1) The Woman with Dissociation was subjected to systematic sexual\nand physical abuse from her father between the ages of 9 and 15 years,\ntogether  with  physical  abuse  from  her  mother  (e.g.  hitting  her  with  a\nsaucepan or an iron). Her father broke her collar-bone on one occasion,\nand her mother threw her younger brother out of the door, crushing his\nskull  “like  a  melon”.  (2)  The  Reluctant  Fiancée  was  repeatedly  and\nbrutally  beaten,  emotionally  battered,  and  sexually  abused  by  her  fa-\nther.  Her  mother  was  constantly  ill  and  made  no  attempt  to  help.

(5)  The  Cold-Blooded\nBusinessman had his hands held against a hot stove by his mother until\nthey  burned,  because  he  objected  to  eating  something  that  she  was\ncooking. From then on he refused to eat anything cooked by her. The\nsituation  ended  with  a  traumatic  separation—he  was  sent  away  to  a\n“health camp” at the age of 10 for three years, where his parents seldom\nvisited him. As an adult he became very severely depressed, and he only\nasked for therapy as a last resort to save himself from suicide, which he\nhad planned to the last detail.\nIn addition, the life of The Man Divided was completely controlled\nby his mother’s severe neurosis—for example, at the age of 13 he had to\nmake  a  thousand-mile  train  journey  to  boarding-school,  by  himself,\nbecause his mother was phobic about flying. When he was 5 years old,\nhis  home  was  destroyed  by  a  gas  explosion  in  which  they  lost  every-\nthing and his father was seriously injured.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jodde\\OneDrive\\Skrivebord\\Konfidens_sommerjobb\\Repos\\freud\\documents\\David Malan,  Patricia Coughlin Della Selva - Lives Transformed_  A Revolutionary Method of Dynamic Psychotherapy-Karnac Books (2006).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Lives Transformed","Author":"Malan, David H.,Della Selva, Patricia Coughlin","Subject":"prelims: press 16 December 2005","Keywords":"","Creator":"Adobe PageMaker 7.0","Producer":"Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)","CreationDate":"D:20051216100732Z","ModDate":"D:20120607113530-04'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"pdf:producer":"Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)","pdf:keywords":"","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe PageMaker 7.0","xmp:modifydate":"2012-06-07T11:35:30-04:00","xmp:createdate":"2005-12-16T10:07:32Z","xmp:metadatadate":"2012-06-07T11:35:30-04:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:4cda6627-6c71-42c0-be8c-6048e3dbd682","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:6e80397a-0384-4b27-835f-27f7121131bb","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:description":"prelims: press 16 December 2005","dc:title":"Lives transformed","dc:creator":"Malan & Coughlin Della Selva"}},"totalPages":353},"loc":{"pageNumber":256,"lines":{"from":29,"to":49}}}}],["491",{"pageContent":"246\nGENERAL\n \nDISCUSSION\nSevere psychopathology\nCorrespondingly, the initial disturbances in at least five of these patients\nwould seem to have made them very difficult to treat with traditional\ndynamic therapy.

Nevertheless,  only  ISTDP  has  re-\nvealed both their presence and their primitive quality in so many pa-\ntients, so that this really amounts to a new discovery.

Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. \r\n\r\nIn this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. \r\n\r\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. \r\n\r\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jodde\\OneDrive\\Skrivebord\\Konfidens_sommerjobb\\Repos\\freud\\documents\\state_of_the_union.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":25}}}}],["679",{"pageContent":"Please rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. \r\n\r\nThroughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.   \r\n\r\nThey keep moving.   \r\n\r\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.   \r\n\r\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. \r\n\r\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations. \r\n\r\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters. \r\n\r\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. \r\n\r\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. \r\n\r\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond.

Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \r\n\r\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \r\n\r\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \r\n\r\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \r\n\r\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \r\n\r\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \r\n\r\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \r\n\r\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \r\n\r\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jodde\\OneDrive\\Skrivebord\\Konfidens_sommerjobb\\Repos\\freud\\documents\\state_of_the_union.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":310,"to":334}}}}],["691",{"pageContent":"Drug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. \r\n\r\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. \r\n\r\nSecond – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.  \r\n\r\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. \r\n\r\nThird – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.  \r\n\r\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.  \r\n\r\nMy plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work. \r\n\r\nMy plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.  \r\n\r\nAll of these will lower costs. \r\n\r\nAnd under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes.

But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. \r\n\r\nJust last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.  \r\n\r\nThat’s simply not fair.

It will grow the economy and lower costs for families. \r\n\r\nSo what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.  \r\n\r\nMy plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. \r\n\r\nThe previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. \r\n\r\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jodde\\OneDrive\\Skrivebord\\Konfidens_sommerjobb\\Repos\\freud\\documents\\state_of_the_union.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":352,"to":376}}}}],["693",{"pageContent":"But in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back. \r\n\r\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.  \r\n\r\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.  \r\n\r\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \r\n\r\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition. \r\n\r\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. \r\n\r\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices. \r\n\r\nWhen corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. \r\n\r\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. \r\n\r\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. \r\n\r\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. \r\n\r\nAnd as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  \r\n\r\nThat ends on my watch. \r\n\r\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jodde\\OneDrive\\Skrivebord\\Konfidens_sommerjobb\\Repos\\freud\\documents\\state_of_the_union.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":376,"to":404}}}}],["694",{"pageContent":"That ends on my watch. \r\n\r\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. \r\n\r\nWe’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. \r\n\r\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  \r\n\r\nRaise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. \r\n\r\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges. \r\n\r\nAnd let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.  \r\n\r\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America. \r\n\r\nFor more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. \r\n\r\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. \r\n\r\nBut I also know this. \r\n\r\nBecause of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \r\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \r\n\r\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\jodde\\OneDrive\\Skrivebord\\Konfidens_sommerjobb\\Repos\\freud\\documents\\state_of_the_union.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":404,"to":429}}}}],["695",{"pageContent":"we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \r\n\r\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.  \r\n\r\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines. \r\n\r\nUnder these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.   \r\n\r\nAnd based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. \r\n\r\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.  \r\n\r\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”.

Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \r\n\r\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \r\n\r\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \r\n\r\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \r\n\r\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \r\n\r\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic.
